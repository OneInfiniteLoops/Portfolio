      <p>
        As a long-time tech enthusiast who loves learning about the latest
        innovations, I recently embarked on my journey to become a full-stack
        developer through the Northcoders’ coding bootcamp in Manchester, UK. At
        the bootcamp, I gained hands-on experience in developing web and mobile
        applications, various key skills and industry best practices such as
        Test-Driven Development (TDD). I also volunteered to present a
        live-streamed lightning talk which has reinforced my passion for
        technology – and its impact on society.
