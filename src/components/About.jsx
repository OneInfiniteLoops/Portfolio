      <h1>About Me.</h1>
      <p>
        As a long-time tech enthusiast who has always been captivated by digital
        innovations, I decided that beyond being an admirer of tech I wanted to
        also get involved and be a part of the digital revolution. In April
        2022, I embarked on my journey to become a full-stack developer at the
        Northcodersâ€™ coding bootcamp in Manchester, UK.

        Through the bootcamp, I gained hands-on experience in developing web and
        mobile applications, learnt various key skills, and applied industry

        opportunity to deliver a live-streamed{" "}

        on the topic of super-apps which has further inspired me to learn more
        about technology and its role in society.
